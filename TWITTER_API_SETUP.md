# Twitter API Setup Guide

## Current Status

The social pulse feature is currently showing **mock data** because the Twitter API connection is failing. While your API key is valid, we're encountering a rate limit error (429 Too Many Requests).

## Issue Details

1. Your Twitter API key is valid and has the correct format
2. However, when trying to fetch tweets, we're hitting the Twitter API rate limit
3. The Twitter API has strict limits on the number of requests you can make in a certain time period

## Rate Limiting

Twitter API has strict rate limits:
- Standard API: 450 requests per 15-minute window
- Search API: 180 requests per 15-minute window

When you hit these limits, the API returns a 429 "Too Many Requests" error, and you need to wait until the rate limit resets before making more requests.

## How to Fix

1. **Wait and try again**:
   - The rate limit will reset after a certain period (usually 15 minutes)
   - Run the fetch script again after waiting:
     ```bash
     node scripts/fetch-real-twitter-data.js
     ```

2. **Optimize your API usage**:
   - Reduce the frequency of API calls
   - Cache results when possible
   - Use pagination to fetch data in smaller chunks

3. **Consider upgrading your Twitter API plan**:
   - Higher tier plans have higher rate limits
   - Visit the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) for more information

## Verifying the Connection

You can verify that your Twitter API connection is working by running:

```bash
node scripts/validate-twitter-api.js
```

This script will:
1. Check if your API key is set
2. Validate the format of your API key
3. Make a test request to the Twitter API
4. Provide detailed error information if the connection fails

## Using Mock Data

While you're waiting for the rate limit to reset, the application will continue to use mock data. The mock data is generated by the `fetch-real-twitter-data.js` script and saved to `public/data/twitter-data.json`.

To update the mock data:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-real-twitter-data.js
```

This will generate fresh mock data and save it to the file, which the application will then use.

## Database Integration

For full functionality, you would also need to:

1. Apply the Twitter integration migration to create the necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-migration.js supabase/migrations/006_twitter_integration.sql
   ```

2. Set up proper Supabase credentials in the `.env` file

However, the application is designed to work without the database tables by falling back to using the data from the file.
