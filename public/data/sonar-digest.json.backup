  "rawHtml": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a weekly AI news digest from April 16 to April 23, 2025. The user wants the most impactful news that's both viral and valuable. Let me start by going through the search results provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the sources, there's a lot about viral AI image trends driving up water consumption. That's mentioned in sources [2] and [10]. It seems like this was a big issue, especially with the Studio Ghibli-style portraits. People on social media are generating tons of images, which is causing environmental concerns. The water usage per ChatGPT response is significant, so this is both viral due to social media trends and valuable because of the environmental impact.\n\nNext, Microsoft's AI security agents are covered in [4]. They expanded their Security Copilot with autonomous agents handling phishing and cyberattacks. This is probably valuable for enterprise security and could be viral if there's a lot of discussion about AI in cybersecurity. The numbers like 7,000 password attacks per second make it impactful.\n\nThen, there's the AI-generated action figure trend mentioned in [9] and [3]. People are turning selfies into action figures and Studio Ghibli avatars, which is super viral on platforms like Twitter. The privacy concerns here are valuable because it raises questions about data usage by AI companies. Experts like Peter Salib from UH commented on this, so including his insights would be good.\n\nGoogle's Agent-to-Agent protocol and Anthropic's MCP Claude are discussed in [8] and [3]. The MCP Claude creating full storyboards automatically is trending on social media with high user engagement. This is valuable for content creation and automation in industries. The integration with Gemini-Veo for understanding physics from [15] adds to its significance.\n\nLastly, the U.S.-China AI infrastructure race from [2], [10], and [12] talks about the Stargate project and performance gaps closing. This is geopolitically important and valuable for understanding global AI dominance. The viral aspect might come from policy discussions and economic implications on social media.\n\nI need to structure each topic with summary, why it's viral, why valuable, insights, and citations. Make sure to use the provided sources and link them correctly. Also, check dates to ensure all news falls within the specified week. Some sources are from April 16-17, which fit the timeframe. The AI Index Report [12] from April 18 adds recent data on U.S.-China competition. The Apple research on differential privacy in [13] is from April 16, so that's within the week too.\n\nWait, the user wants exactly 5 topics. Let me confirm the top 5:\n\n1. Viral AI Image Trends and Water Consumption\n2. Microsoft's Autonomous Security Agents\n3. AI-Generated Action Figures and Privacy Concerns\n4. Advancements in AI Agent Technology\n5. U.S.-China AI Infrastructure and Performance Race\n\nEach of these has both viral and valuable aspects. The citations should include the relevant search results and any social media links provided, like tweets from [3]. Make sure to format the HTML correctly with the specified structure. Avoid markdown, use HTML tags as instructed. Check for any other news in the sources that might have been missed, but the top 5 seem covered.\n</think>\n\n<h1>Weekly AI News Digest: April 16, 2025 - April 23, 2025</h1>\n<p>This week saw AI dominate both technological innovation and social discourse, with viral consumer applications sparking environmental concerns, major cybersecurity advancements from Microsoft, and escalating geopolitical AI infrastructure investments.
