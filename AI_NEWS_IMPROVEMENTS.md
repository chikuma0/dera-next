# AI News Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the AI news system to address the issue of "boring news" and enhance the quality and diversity of AI news content.

## Problem

The original AI news system was only fetching from Google News RSS feeds with specific queries, and the scoring system wasn't effectively identifying truly interesting AI news.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution that:

1. **Enhanced the scoring system** to better identify interesting AI news
2. **Added alternative news sources** beyond Google News
3. **Implemented a fallback mechanism** to fetch from alternative sources when needed

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Scoring System

- Increased keyword weights to better identify interesting news
- Added new hot AI topics with high weights (Claude 3, GPT-5, Gemini, etc.)
- Improved the final score calculation to prioritize high-quality sources
- Added source bonuses for reputable tech sources
- Ensured alternative sources get a minimum score to give them a chance

### 2. Alternative News Sources

Added the following alternative sources:

- **Hacker News**: Tech-focused AI news with community curation
- **Reddit**: Community-curated AI content from r/artificial, r/MachineLearning, r/OpenAI, and r/LocalLLaMA
- **ArXiv**: Research papers related to AI and machine learning

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

- The API now checks if there are enough interesting news items (at least 5 with score > 100)
- If not enough interesting news is found, it automatically fetches from alternative sources
- The Dashboard component displays these alternative sources alongside traditional news

## New Scripts

### Update News Scores

The `scripts/update-news-scores.js` script updates the scores for all existing articles with our improved scoring system:

```bash
node scripts/update-news-scores.js
```

### Refresh News with Alternatives

The `scripts/refresh-news-with-alternatives.js` script fetches news from both traditional and alternative sources:

```bash
node scripts/refresh-news-with-alternatives.js
```

## API Enhancements

The news API endpoint now supports additional parameters:

- `refresh=true`: Fetch new data from sources
- `alternative=true`: Explicitly use alternative sources

Example:
```
/api/news?language=en&refresh=true&alternative=true
```

## Usage

To ensure you always have interesting AI news:

1. Run the refresh script periodically (e.g., daily):
   ```bash
   node scripts/refresh-news-with-alternatives.js
   ```

2. Visit the Media Hub page to see the latest AI news:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/media-hub
   ```

3. If you want to manually update the scores without fetching new content:
   ```bash
   node scripts/update-news-scores.js
   ```

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Add more alternative sources (e.g., Hugging Face, GitHub trending AI repositories)
2. Implement sentiment analysis to identify positive/negative news
3. Add personalization features to tailor news to user interests
4. Implement clustering to group similar news items
5. Add image extraction for more visually appealing news items
