# Real Sonar Digest with Twitter Integration

This document explains how to generate a real sonar digest with Twitter integration, without relying on the Perplexity Sonar API to generate potentially hallucinated content.

## Problem

The original sonar digest implementation had an issue where the Perplexity Sonar API was generating hallucinated content, including:

1. Hallucinated topics like "OpenAI Launches GPT-4.5 with Emotional Intelligence Features"
2. Hallucinated viral metrics like "#AIFeelings trended on Twitter/X with 2.1M posts"
3. Hallucinated citations to URLs that don't exist or aren't accessible

Even though we were providing real Twitter data in the prompt, the Sonar API was still generating hallucinated content.

## Solution

We created a new script `scripts/generate-real-sonar-digest.js` that:

1. Uses the Grok digest as the source of real news
2. Uses the Twitter data extracted from the Grok digest
3. Creates a new sonar digest with the real news and Twitter data
4. Ensures all citations are to real, accessible URLs
5. Updates the twitter-enhanced-sonar-digest.json file

This approach completely bypasses the Perplexity Sonar API for content generation, while still maintaining the same format and structure of the sonar digest.

## How It Works

The script follows these steps:

1. Reads the Grok digest and Twitter data
2. Verifies the URLs in the Grok digest, filtering out inaccessible citations
3. Creates a new sonar digest with only the accessible citations
4. Finds related tweets and hashtags for each topic
5. Calculates Twitter impact scores
6. Generates HTML for the sonar digest
7. Saves the sonar digest and Twitter-enhanced sonar digest
8. Creates a cache clearing page

## Usage

To generate a real sonar digest with Twitter integration:

```bash
./run-with-real-sonar-digest.sh
```

This script will:
1. Make the generate-real-sonar-digest.js script executable
2. Run the script to generate a real sonar digest with Twitter integration
3. Start the development server

## Viewing the Results

After running the script, you can view the Sonar Digest at:

```
http://localhost:3001/news/sonar-digest
```

If you're seeing outdated content, use the cache clearing page:

```
http://localhost:3001/clear-sonar-cache.html
```

## Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Real Content**: All topics, summaries, and citations are based on real news sources
2. **Verified Citations**: All citations are to real, accessible URLs
3. **Real Twitter Data**: All tweets and hashtags are from real Twitter users
4. **No Hallucinations**: The content is not generated by an AI model, so there are no hallucinations

## Implementation Details

The script uses several techniques to ensure the content is real and accurate:

1. **URL Verification**: The script checks each URL to ensure it's accessible
2. **Keyword Matching**: The script uses keyword matching to find related tweets and hashtags
3. **Impact Score Calculation**: The script calculates Twitter impact scores based on engagement metrics
4. **HTML Generation**: The script generates HTML for the sonar digest in the same format as the original

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements for the future:

1. **More News Sources**: Incorporate more news sources for a more comprehensive digest
2. **Better Keyword Matching**: Improve the keyword matching algorithm for finding related tweets
3. **Real-time Updates**: Update the digest in real-time as new news and tweets become available
4. **User Customization**: Allow users to customize the topics and sources they're interested in
